// creating a remote repository
I used the github website to add an empty repository

// creating a new repository for an existing directory
cd into directory you want to put under git
  in this directory I made a folder that contained the stuff I wanted under git...
  it had nothing else... except the mac .DS_Store stuff

git init

git add .

git commit

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/DiaperGlu/Test.git

git push -u origin main
